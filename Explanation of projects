The CNN file requires a training data set and test data set to run properly. i do have these available and if you want them you will need to request for them as they cannot be uploaded here.
every file required for the codes to run is available and should be requested since it cannot be uploaded here
the CNN model is one that  i built to be able to tell the difference between an emergency vehicle(ambulane, police cars etc) and a non emergency vehicle(private vehicles)
